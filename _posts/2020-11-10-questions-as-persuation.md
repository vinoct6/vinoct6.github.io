During meetings at work, I'm mindful of making bold declarative statements and prefer using questions as a primary means of communication. 
Questions can be used to impart and gather information, refocus points of view and  bring or deflect attention on the subject.
You might already know the answer, but someone in the meeting might not, so questions can be a means to impart information.

In a complex environment, with multiple teams, it is hard for one person to know all the information. So, the problem with
using declarative statements is, you own the statement you *declared*, and if doesn't work out - what you say become less trustworthy.
This is the worst place to be when you're trying to persuade people. 

With questions however, there is always an _out_. If you're dead wrong, you could say, "_I did not know that_", and if you are right
you could say "_I thought so_". Questions have a soft landing.

There is such a thing as a ill thought out, poorly phrased question (_stupid_ question?) - but such a question is much better than a stupid declarative statement.
