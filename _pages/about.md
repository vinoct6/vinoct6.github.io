I'm Vinoth. I live with my wife and son in London.

I'm a lead software engineer, architect and engineering manager by profession. I am equally at ease with hands-on programming,
software architecture and leading engineering teams. 
Iâ€™m top [4% of the users in Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/571718/vinoth-kumar-c-m) and [top 1% of users in Software Development Stackexchange](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/17887/vinoth-kumar-c-m). 

In my free time, I read. I read **a lot**. I always have paperbacks or Kindle with me ... just in case. My favorite trips are to 
bookshops in London ( Waterstones, Foyles, Daunt books, London Review Bookshop etc.,) and I spend endless hours browsing in public libraries in London.

I read across variety of disciplines (Literature, History, Political Science, Economics, Philosophy, Computer Science etc.,).
My thinking and mindset, is constantly influenced by what I read and this inevitably influences the way I work. 

My core skill lies in the intersection of different disciplines - my ability to: learn things quickly, borrow ideas from different disciplines, 
create stories and narratives, inspire people etc., 

This blog is to capture the concepts, ideas, excerpts etc., from what I read.
