I'm Vinoth and I live in London. 

I'm a lead software engineer, architect and engineering manager by profession. I'm most fulfilled at work when I enable people to reach their potential.
When I'm not working or spending time with my family, I read. I read **a lot**. I always make sure that I have my kindle and iPad with me. My favorite trips are to 
the book shops in London ( Waterstones, Foyles, Daunt books) and I spend endless hours browsing in libraries in London ( the one in Barbican center is my favorite)

I read across variety of disciplines (Literature, History, Political Science, Economics, Philosophy, Computer Science etc.,) , and the interest varies from time to time. 

These days, I'm interested in the overarching questions of
    - The problem of knowledge:  How do we know what we know ? How do we effectively search for information ? how do we retain knowledge ?  etc.,
    - The problem of conduct: How do we conduct ourselves ? What are the biases that affect our conduct ? etc.,
    - The problem of organisation: How do we organise ourselves into teams to become greater than ourselves.
    
I'm here to mostly write about leadership, digital transformation, programming & technology among other things.
