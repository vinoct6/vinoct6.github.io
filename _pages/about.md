![My Picture](images/about_me.jpg)

I'm Vinoth. I live with my wife and son in London.

I'm a lead software engineer, architect and engineering manager by profession. I am equally at ease with hands-on programming,
reasoning about abstractions in software architecture and leading engineering teams. 
Iâ€™m top [4% of the users in Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/571718/vinoth-kumar-c-m) and [top 1% of users in Software Development Stackexchange](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/17887/vinoth-kumar-c-m). 


In my free time, I read. I read **a lot**. I always have paperbacks or Kindle with me .. just in case. My favorite trips are to 
the bookshops in London ( Waterstones, Foyles, Daunt books, London Review Bookshop etc.,) and I spend endless hours browsing in public libraries in London.

I read across variety of disciplines (Literature, History, Political Science, Economics, Philosophy, Computer Science etc.,).

This blog is to capture the concepts, ideas, quotes etc., from what I read.
